-Rubber Bands, Scissors, Rulers and Trimmers, Bookcases and Tables brought the least profit and also loss to the company and I will recommend that these products be discontinued. Tables and bookcases brought about the greatest loss and should not be included in the companies sales in the coming years.

-Tables despite making much sales resulted in loss. Therefore, office machines and telephones and communications were the best selling items and I recommend the company to keep selling them.
